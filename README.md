# Live-ISS-Tracker
The ISS Tracker web application is designed to provide real-time information about the International Space Station (ISS). The application includes a dynamic map displaying the ISS's current location, along with essential details such as latitude, longitude, time, speed, altitude, and visibility.

How It Works
 Upon loading the webpage, the map is initialized using Leaflet, centered on predefined latitude and longitude coordinates.
 The application fetches real-time ISS data, including latitude, longitude, timestamp, speed, altitude, and visibility, from the provided API.
 The map marker and view are updated to reflect the current ISS location.
 Information about the ISS, such as latitude, longitude, time, speed, altitude, and visibility, is displayed on the webpage.
 The page is automatically refreshed at regular intervals to keep the information up-to-date.
